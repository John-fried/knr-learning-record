[Function Declarations]

	return-type function-name(parameter declarations, if any)
	{
		declarations
		statement
	}

: Function stack
	A function have their own stack memory,
	so they have its own local variable that
	can't be accessed with another function/statement/expression

[Return statement/expression]
if the function have a return-type (eg. non-void), the return
statement will be like this:

	return expression;

? Does return statement is required
	No, a function declaration need not to return a value;
	a return statement with no expression causes control,
	but no useful value to be returned to the caller,
	:
		just terminate a function with right brace
	: no return statement
		you may get warning, but the code still
		can run
